## ISSUE-001: Explosive Growth in Latent Factor [In Progress]
**Module**: train/train.py:ALSModel
**Priority**: High
**Created**: 2025-07-11
**Description**: The latent factor in the ALS model is growing exponentially, leading to singluar matrix and instability.

**Log Entries**:
[info] The metadata have a large, unnormalized number. We need to find the source.
[info] Preprocessing does not delete the ID. It carried to latent calculation. Try dropping the ID column for both user and item.
[info] Decide not to drop the ID column. Instead, we alter the metadata range since it is the one responsible to picking metadata properties.
[info] Apprently there are other sources of explosion. First and second iteration seems fine, but the third iteration is already exploding. Commit the changes here.
